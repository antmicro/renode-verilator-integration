This repository contains sample Verilog models as well as wrapper code for co-simulation with [Renode](https://github.com/renode/renode).
You can find more information on usage and implementation details in the [co-simulation chapter of the Renode documentation](https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/co-simulating-with-a-hdl-simulator.html).

This is historically the first co-simulation method available in Renode; since then two other methods have been added, each with their own example repository linked below:

* [Verilog DPI](https://github.com/antmicro/renode-dpi-examples)
* [SystemC](https://github.com/antmicro/renode-systemc-examples)
